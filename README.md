# How to select rows with checkbox and delete the selected rows in .NET-MAUI-DataGrid.
In this article, we will show you how to select rows with checkbox and delete the selected rows in [.Net Maui DataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-datagrid). The dataGrid_CellValueChanged method updates the selection in the data grid based on changes in the "IsChecked" column. It adjusts the selected index and removes unchecked rows from the selection, ensuring the data grid stays accurate.

The Button_Clicked method handles the button click event by removing selected rows from the dataGrid. It retrieves the view model and gets the list of checked items. If there are any, it removes them from the OrderInfoCollection and clears the dataGrid selection.

## C#
The below code illustrates how to select rows with checkbox and delete the selected rows in DataGrid.
```
List<int> index = new List<int>();

private void dataGrid_CellValueChanged(object sender, Syncfusion.Maui.DataGrid.DataGridCellValueChangedEventArgs e)
{
    var rowData = e.RowData as OrderModel;
    if (e.Column.MappingName == "IsChecked")
    {               
        
        this.dataGrid!.SelectedIndex = e.RowColumnIndex.RowIndex;
        Debug.WriteLine(e.RowColumnIndex.RowIndex);
        int num = e.RowColumnIndex.RowIndex;
        this.dataGrid!.SelectedIndex = num;
        
    }
    if (e.Column.MappingName == "IsChecked" && !(rowData.IsChecked))
    {
        this.dataGrid!.SelectedRows.Remove(rowData);
    }
    
}

private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var model = this.viewModel!;
    OrderInfoRepository orderInfoRepository = model;
    int count = index.Count;
    var selectedItems = model.OrderInfoCollection.Where(item => item.IsChecked).ToList();
    if (selectedItems.Any())
    {
        // bool deleteConfirmed = DisplayAlert("Delete Rows", "Do you want to delete the selected rows?", "Yes", "No").Result;
        if (true)
        {
            foreach (var item in selectedItems)
            {
                model.OrderInfoCollection.Remove(item);
            }
        }
    }
    
    this.dataGrid!.ClearSelection();
}
```
